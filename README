Triple Tools

Stand-alone command-line scripts to process streams of ntriples (RDF).



ntfilter 
- like grep for triples

ntdebnode 
- remove bnodes and replace them with an actual URI

nthash 
- replace some URIs with a hashed version to obfuscate them. Can also 
output a list of sameAs triples to de-obfuscate later.

ntcat
- concatenates two or more ntriples files and adds a prefix to the bnodes
in each file to avoid clashes.A
